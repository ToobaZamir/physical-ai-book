# Placeholder script for generating PDF and ePub deliverables.
# A real implementation would use Pandoc or a similar tool to convert the markdown files from the 'docs' directory into the desired formats.

Write-Host "Generating PDF and ePub deliverables..."
Write-Host "This is a placeholder script. No files will be generated."

# Example using Pandoc (if it were installed and configured):
# pandoc --from=markdown --to=pdf --output=physical-ai-book.pdf docs/**/*.md
# pandoc --from=markdown --to=epub --output=physical-ai-book.epub docs/**/*.md

Write-Host "Done."
