## Key Standards

- All technical claims must be verifiable against official documentation (e.g., ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, Gazebo).
- Citation format: APA or IEEE style for references to tools, papers, or hardware specs.
- Source types: Minimum 60% from official vendor docs, peer-reviewed robotics/AI papers, and industry reports.
- Plagiarism check: 0% tolerance; all content original or properly attributed.
- Writing clarity: Technical yet accessible, Flesch-Kincaid grade 12-14 for an engineering audience.

## Constraints

- Structure: Divided into modules, weekly breakdowns, hardware sections, and assessments.
- Length: 50-100 pages equivalent, including diagrams and code snippets.
- Format: PDF or eBook with embedded links to resources, diagrams for hardware setups.
- Minimum 20 references/sources for tools, hardware, and case studies.

## Governance

- All hardware and software recommendations must be verified for compatibility and current availability.
- There must be zero factual errors in technical specs or tool descriptions.
- The content must pass a review for educational value and practical applicability.
- The book must provide comprehensive coverage of Physical AI principles from simulation to deployment.
