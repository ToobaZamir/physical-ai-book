## Constitution Compliance Verification

- [ ] CHK001 Verify responses are grounded only in book content with retrieval-augmented generation (Accuracy principle)
- [ ] CHK002 Confirm design prioritizes learning journey of AI/robotics students at various skill levels (User-centric principle)
- [ ] CHK003 Validate system demonstrates reliability for ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac Sim, and other book topics (Reliability principle)
- [ ] CHK004 Confirm no user queries are stored or logged, maintaining stateless conversations (Privacy principle)
- [ ] CHK005 Verify architecture leverages free-tier services within resource constraints (Scalability principle)
- [ ] CHK006 Confirm implementation uses specified tech stack (OpenAI Agents/ChatKit, FastAPI, Neon, Qdrant) (Tech consistency principle)

## Quality Assurance

- [ ] CHK007 Test achieves ≥90% accuracy on test queries related to book content (per constitution)
- [ ] CHK008 Verify response time is <5s for all queries (per constitution)
- [ ] CHK009 Confirm system passes 20+ test scenarios covering various book topics (per constitution)
- [ ] CHK010 Validate system operates within free-tier limits (Neon: ~500MB, Qdrant: 1GB)
- [ ] CHK011 Confirm no external knowledge or web search capabilities are implemented

## Privacy & Security

- [ ] CHK012 Verify no persistent storage of user questions or interactions
- [ ] CHK013 Confirm all conversations are stateless
- [ ] CHK014 Validate no user data is logged inappropriately
- [ ] CHK015 Test privacy compliance with user query handling

## Performance & Scalability

- [ ] CHK016 Test system performance within free-tier resource constraints
- [ ] CHK017 Validate system handles scaling appropriately
- [ ] CHK018 Confirm cost-effective LLM usage (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo when possible)

## Documentation & Integration

- [ ] CHK019 Verify embeddable widget works in Docusaurus (GitHub Pages)
- [ ] CHK020 Confirm comprehensive documentation exists (README.md)
- [ ] CHK021 Validate Flesch-Kincaid grade level 8-12 for responses
- [ ] CHK022 Test graceful handling of out-of-scope queries
